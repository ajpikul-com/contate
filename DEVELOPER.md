# MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENT

There are four _main_ sections:

1) Some stupid functions at the topic

Like an output function for errors and stuff

There is also set -a, which honestly.. is stupid.
* We should look at each variable and determine wether or not it needs to be "set" and therfore inherited or not.

2) The file parser

This is a while loop that searches for the contate syntax

* There is probably a FAR superior approach

I'm not 100% sure it's going to copy the developer's code faithfully, but it's doing well so far, ever since I took the '-e' flag off echo.

* I'd like it to subtract ALL indents up the shebang

* I'd like it to parse and help the developer

3) The flag parser

* Maybe a bit more secure

4) The recursion/path manipulator

* Should probably just steal source code from the 'cp' command
